## Completed Tasks
1. **Read Patient Information**: Implemented a method to read patient information from the Wilson Central Terminal ECG Database using a hardcoded format.
2. **Basic Signal Processing Functions**: Developed basic functions like Low-pass and High-pass filters.
3. **ECGProcessor Class**: Created a base class named `ECGProcessor` for the project.
4. **BPM Calculation**: Developed a function to calculate the Beats Per Minute (BPM) from ECG signals.
5. **FFT Implementation**: Performed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze frequency content.
6. **Signal Visualization**: Visualized filtered ECG signals.
7. **GUI Development**: Created a user-friendly GUI for importing signal files and displaying calculated information such as BPM.
8. **GUI Function Implementation**: Integrated signal processing functions into the GUI.
9. **Advanced Features**: Added additional functionalities like displaying frequency spectrums and wavelet transform.
