# Electrocardiogram (ECG) Signal Analysis and Basic Cardiac Diagnostics using MATLAB and Simulink

## Objective
This project aims to create a Simulink model for ECG signal processing and implement basic functions in a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Software Requirements
- MATLAB (R2023b Release)
- Simulink (R2023b Release)

## Extensions
- WFDB Toolbox (Waveform Database Toolbox)

## Resources
- [WFDB Toolbox](https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/matlab/wfdb-app-matlab/)
- Data Acquired from: [Wilson Central Terminal ECG Database](https://physionet.org/content/wctecgdb/1.0.1/)

## Completed Tasks
1. **Read Patient Information**: Implemented a method to read patient information from the Wilson Central Terminal ECG Database using a hardcoded format.
2. **Basic Signal Processing Functions**: Developed basic functions like Low-pass and High-pass filters.
3. **ECGProcessor Class**: Created a base class named `ECGProcessor` for the project.
4. **BPM Calculation**: Developed a function to calculate the Beats Per Minute (BPM) from ECG signals.
5. **FFT Implementation**: Performed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze frequency content.
6. **Signal Visualization**: Visualized filtered ECG signals.
7. **GUI Development**: Created a user-friendly GUI for importing signal files and displaying calculated information such as BPM.
8. **GUI Function Implementation**: Integrated signal processing functions into the GUI.
9. **Advanced Features**: Added additional functionalities like displaying frequency spectrums and wavelet transform.
